### 🤔 Problem Statement
Collaborating on coding projects in real-time can be a challenge, especially when team members are working remotely or in different time zones. Current solutions such as sharing code through email, chat or version control systems can be time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, these methods may not allow for real-time collaboration, making it difficult to quickly iterate on ideas and solve coding problems as a team. 

### 🚀 Solution
Thus, I have developed ***CodeCollab***, a web solution that allows multiple users to code together in real-time, and you can also run and save the code file, with a chat feature for easy communication and support for multiple languages.
